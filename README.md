#SHOPPING CART

A simple JavaScript shopping cart that applies some deals to the total price via set pricing rules.

I decided to write this in JavaScript, because I've been using it with my React dev over the last few months.
I also went with a test driven approach using mocha and chai.

##Prerequisites
Node.js to run the main shopping script.
npm for testing.

##Instructions:
Run with: $node shopping.js

##Testing:
Install mocha and chai with: $npm install
Test with: $npm run test
